# Moving Assistant Agentic AI Development Training Project
• Enterprise clients faced inefficient moving service price comparisons (avg. 2 hours/request) with no automation tools. 
• As technical lead, validate LLM's chained execution in real-world scenarios and design an actionable price comparison solution. 
• To target the issue: 
  • Product Positioning: Packaged the ETL pipeline as "Smart Moving Assistant" with core value proposition ("5-minute cross-platform comparisons").
  • Technical Implementation: Applied generative AI (OpenAI GPT/Whisper APIs) to develop an price comparison tool, demonstrating LLM applications for operational automation
• Demonstrated 98% efficiency gain (2hrs→5mins) through testing with moving industry stakeholders, which proved the ProductMarket-Fit and dealt with user’s pain point (displaying high GTM potential).
